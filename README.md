# CICD Pipeline for Java Application to deploy on Kubernetes Cluster using Jenkins
Overview
This project aims to establish a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for a Java application to be deployed on a Kubernetes cluster using Jenkins. The pipeline automates the build process, Dockerizes the application, pushes the Docker image to a private registry, and facilitates the deployment on a Kubernetes cluster with manual approval.

Features
Automation with Jenkins: Jenkins is utilized to automate the build process using Maven.
Dockerization: The application is Dockerized to create a portable and consistent environment for deployment.
Private Docker Registry: Docker images are pushed to a private registry for secure storage and distribution.
Manual Approval: Deployment to the Kubernetes cluster requires manual approval, ensuring control over production releases.
Deployment on Kubernetes: The application is deployed on a Kubernetes cluster, leveraging its orchestration capabilities for scalability and resilience.
Pipeline Steps
Source Code Checkout: Jenkins fetches the source code from the repository.
Build with Maven: Maven is used to build the Java application.
Dockerization: The application is containerized using Docker.
Push to Private Registry: Docker image is pushed to the private registry for versioning and sharing.
Manual Approval: Deployment is paused, awaiting manual approval to proceed.
Deployment on Kubernetes: Upon approval, the application is deployed on the Kubernetes cluster.
Requirements
Jenkins: Install and configure Jenkins for CI/CD automation.
Maven: Set up Maven for building Java applications.
Docker: Install Docker for containerization.
Private Docker Registry: Utilize a private Docker registry for image storage.
Kubernetes Cluster: Have a Kubernetes cluster set up for deploying the application.
Access Permissions: Ensure Jenkins has appropriate permissions to interact with the Git repository, Docker registry, and Kubernetes cluster.
Usage
Configure Jenkins with the necessary plugins for Maven, Docker, and Kubernetes integration.
Set up Jenkins pipeline job with the provided Jenkinsfile defining the CI/CD stages.
Configure Jenkins credentials for accessing the Git repository and Docker registry.
Define Kubernetes credentials in Jenkins for deployment.
Trigger the pipeline manually or configure webhooks for automatic triggering on code changes.
Monitor the pipeline execution in Jenkins dashboard and proceed with manual approval for deployment.
Verify the application deployment on the Kubernetes cluster.
Future Improvements
Automated Testing: Integrate automated testing into the pipeline for enhanced quality assurance.
Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Implement Infrastructure as Code principles for managing Kubernetes cluster configuration.
Dynamic Scaling: Implement auto-scaling capabilities within the Kubernetes cluster.
Enhanced Security: Strengthen security measures for Jenkins, Docker registry, and Kubernetes cluster.
Monitoring and Logging: Implement monitoring and logging solutions for better observability of the application.
